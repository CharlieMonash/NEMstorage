Please note that these code snippets are not final, and were not necessarily used to create the graphs in this report. Rather they form a basis for others wishing to compare results or build on this work. There may be errors in this code and the code will not continue to be updated.
View this as a (rather messy and incomplete) capsule in time, rather than the live code, that we continue to use.
